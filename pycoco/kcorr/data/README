The files in this dir contain fluxes for Vega in f_lambda
units.  The wavelengths are usually in Angstroms,
but not always.

alpha_lyr_stis_002.fits is the STIS spectrum
 from Bohlin & Gilliland, 2004, AJ, 127, 3508

AB_pseudospectrum.dat is f_nu = 3.63078e-20 erg s^-1 cm^-2 Hz^-1 converted to
f_lambda units erg s^-1 cm^-2 AA^-1
