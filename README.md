This is the development repo for the python frontend for the core-collapse SNe template code 'CoCo':  https://github.com/UoS-SNe/CoCo
(my fork is currently https://github.com/RobFirth/CoCo).

CoCo was originally started by Natasha Karpenka, and is currently being updated and maintained by S. Prajs (https://github.com/SzymonPrajs).

A paper, Firth et. al. 2017, is currently in prep.
___

 * Some spectra had 0 flux at red-extreme, needed to patch (see issue https://github.com/RobFirth/pycoco/issues/41)

 * Extending spectra with "donor" spectra. Bugfixes in v0.9.18.

 * Implemented a raft of changes that make it easier to interact with the spectral fits and the final templates

 * fixed a particularly nasty bug (https://github.com/RobFirth/pycoco/issues/28) that was screwing up specphot (via
 filter resampling)

 * Updated notebook tarball - (again 17/12/17)

 * Now available on PyPi and via `pip` - package available to install as `pycocosn`
 
 * Extending templates now possible with Black Body spectrum, flat and linear

 * calling CoCo (or reproduced CoCo functions) now more straightforward

 * Added more test cases to test_pycoco

 * Travis-CI implemented and Master and dev are passing. Fixed bug with ENVIRONS.

 * Dependancies now handled in setup.py

 * Calling all parts of CoCo from pycoco now operational

 * Migrated to better, and clearer code structure and sub-modules

 * Mangling now done within python, rather than C++ in CoCo

 * File I/O and interaction with `CoCo LCfit` output now operational - 11/01/17

 * Usage of a `SN` class now solid

 * Implementing calls to `CoCo LCfit` now

 * Calls to `CoCo specfit` now implemented

 * Mangling now stable

 * Adding tools for calculating magnitude offsets to make it easier to import new data

 * regeneration of filter list file now possible

 * added colours and bandpasses for LSST filters

 * Less dependence on environment variables

 * installation through `setup.py` now possible

 * better handing of CoCo sim outputs

 * SN position and mu now stored in infofile `./testdata/info/info.dat`

 * dark sky calculations and integration with LSST Throughputs now done

 * Improved stability

 * input from `astropy tables` now more straightforward - better integration with `coco.simulate`

 * can now batch fit light curves and spectra from within python

To install:

```
pip install pycocosn

```

To install from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/RobFirth/verbose-enigma.git
```

then:

```
cd verbose-enigma
python setup.py install --user
```

(The --user argument only installs current user only, omitting flag will install for all users on the system if there are appropriate permissions)

_NOTE: make sure that the python used to install is the one that you will use with pycoco_
___

Ideally set the following environment variables:

`COCO_ROOT_DIR` (my default is `~/Code/CoCo/`)
`PYCOCO_FILTER_DIR`(my default is `~/Code/CoCo/data/filters/`)
`PYCOCO_DATA_DIR` (my default is `~/Code/CoCo/data/`)
`SFD_DIR` (my default is `~/data/Dust/sfddata-master/`; see below)
`LSST_THROUGHPUTS` (my default is `${HOME}/projects/LSST/throughputs`)
`LSST_THROUGHPUTS_BASELINE` (my default is `${LSST_THROUGHPUTS}/baseline`)

also `pycoco/` and `CoCo` need to be in your path and pythonpath, i.e.:

 ```
 setenv PATH /Users/berto/Code/pycoco/:$PATH

 setenv PYTHONPATH "/Users/berto/Code/pycoco/:$PYTHONPATH
 ```

# Requirements
## python packages

* matplotlib
* numpy
* scipy
* astropy
* lmfit
* sfdmap (https://github.com/kbarbary/sfdmap)

# additionally

* lsst throughputs (https://github.com/lsst/throughputs; `$LSST_THROUGHPUTS` points to this directory)
___


for `sfdmap`, the environment variable `SFD_DIR` needs to point at the path to the parent directory of the appropriate dust map files. See the installation instructions here: https://github.com/kbarbary/sfdmap

RuntimeError: Python is not installed as a framework. The Mac OS X backend will not be able to function correctly if Python is not installed as a framework. See the Python documentation for more information on installing Python as a framework on Mac OS X. Please either reinstall Python as a framework, or try one of the other backends. If you are using (Ana)Conda please install python.app and replace the use of 'python' with 'pythonw'. See 'Working with Matplotlib on OSX' in the Matplotlib FAQ for more information.
```
you need to swap the default backend.

If you have installed the pip matplotlib, there is a directory in your root called ``~/.matplotlib`.

Create a file ``~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc` there and add the following:
`backend: TkAgg`
