This is the development repo for the python frontend for the core-collapse SNe template code 'CoCo':  https://github.com/UoS-SNe/CoCo
(my fork is currently https://github.com/RobFirth/CoCo). 

CoCo was originally started by Natasha Karpenka, and is currently being updated and maintained by S. Prajs (https://github.com/SzymonPrajs).

A paper, Karpenka et. al. 2017, is currently in prep.
